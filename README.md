Operations:  Our app functions using the CRUD operations:

**Create** – The user can add quotes to the database. Assign to that quote a  category which it belongs to, and a tag.

**Read** – The app can be used by anyone who just wished to view the quotes of any given category.

**Update** – If the user sees an existing saying and would like to add/change the quote, category or tag associated with it, that can be done too.

**Delete** – A saying or quote that is not correct, misleading, or not appropriate, or a duplicate, may be deleted completely from the database.
